        <h3>Biography</h3>

<p>I am a quantitative ecologist working at <a href="http://creem2.st-andrews.ac.uk/">CREEM</a> at the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/">University of St. Andrews</a>. I received my PhD in Ecology from the <a href="http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/">Nicholas School of the Environment</a> at <a href="http://duke.edu/">Duke University</a>. Prior to graduate school, I held positions at <a href="http://swfsc.noaa.gov/fed.aspx">NOAA Fisheries</a>, and the <a href"http://www.neaq.org/conservation_and_research/index.php">New England Aquarium</a>.</p>

<h3>Research</h3>

<p>My research is on animal and human movement, with an eye towards understanding movement drivers, conservation aspects of movement, and the link between individual condition and behaviour. Specifically, I am interested in how organisms interact with their environment, how these interactions may feedback into the physiological state of the animal, and how, in the presence of human activity, disturbance may influence movement and vital rates. The visualisation and analysis of spatial data lies at the core of all of my research. </p>

<p>I am currently involved in three major research projects: 1) health and condition in right whales; 2) lipid gain/loss in elephant seals; and 3) movement patterns and smoking events in human smokers. </p>
